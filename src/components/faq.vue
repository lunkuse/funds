                            Sending is available to senders in more than 50
                            countries. Customers set the country they are
                            sending from when first signing-up to FundsTrans.
                            For security reasons, you cannot change your send
                            country again online. If you need to switch country,
                            please contact support@fundstrans.com.

                          <p>
                            The maximum amount of money you can send depends on
                            where you live. This is because different countries
                            have different rules relating to money transfers.
                            Sending limits also vary depending on how you pay
                            for the transfer. Card payments often have a
                            different limit to payments from your bank account.

                          <p>
                            Many transfers sent arrive instantly. Some can take
                            longer, depending on how the money is being
                            received. Important: Your transfer will not start
                            until Fundstrans has received payment. E.g. if your
                            payment card is not authorised immediately, the
                            transfer will be delayed slightly. Mobile wallet
                            transfer are nearly instant, cash pickup take 30
                            minutes availablity from sending, bank deposit

                          (within a few seconds). Occasionally, there may be
                          small delays due to congestion on the local mobile
                          network. If you have questions about a longer delay,

                        <p>
                          When sending an airtime top-up, you will be asked to
                          enter the recipient's phone number twice. This is done
                          to ensure that money is not sent to the wrong person
                          because of a single mistyped number.
                          <br />
                          However, if you enter the wrong number twice, the
                          transfer will go ahead and there is no way to reclaim
                          the airtime top-up once it is sent. Please check
                          carefully with the recipient that you have their
                          correct number..

                          Why do some countries deduct tax on airtime top-up?
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                          A number of governments around the world have chosen
                          to apply taxes to incoming airtime top-ups.
                          <br />
                          When sending to these countries, some of the airtime
                          value will be deducted locally, meaning the recipient
                          will get a lower amount. If the country you are
                          sending to does deduct taxes from airtime top-ups, you
                          will see information about the rate on the WorldRemit
                          website or app before completing the transfer.
